# PAPR Model ONE
This is a Personal Air Purification Respirator developed by **Coronavirus Makers** community.

This project has been released under CERN OHL v2 for the hardware part and under the GNU GPL v3 for the software.


PAPR Model ONE aims to be an EPP equiparable to those already on the market.
The key objectives of this project are:
* Open-source
* Low-cost (<200 euros)
* Easy to manufacture, by citizens and industry
* Follow EPP directive (UNE/EN 12941:1999 A1 and A2)
* Equivalent to FFP3
    

In order to acomplish this objetives, the electronics are based on Arduino platform and use easy to find electronics components. Moreover, turbine and helmet support had been designed to be able for been pritned with FDM or SLA 3D printers. Also, the pattern for the fabric coverhead has been developed.

Fabric pattern has been inspired by [open-mask.org].

Turbine model has been inspired by
