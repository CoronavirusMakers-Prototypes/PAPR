# EUvsVirus Hackathon (2020)

##Inspiration
Medical personnel using FFP2 or FFP3 respirators for many hours, causing facial injuries. The shortage of adequate material to carry out activities of professionals who fight against COVID19, is causing many of them to face the Virus in unsuitable conditions, we present an idea that can solve effectively and especially REGULATED by regulations, a competitive price and even The case came as the materials are easily accessible it could be done DIY.

##What it does?
ItÂ´s a Powered Air Purifier Respirator, works by positive pressure isolating the inside of the hood from pathogens like virus. Simply build a positive pressure breathing apparatus with easily accessible materials:

*EU regulations that regulate its construction.
*Technical data
*Construction diagrams
*Connection diagrams
*Validation tests following the applicable and mandatory EU regulations.

##How I built it?
With 3D printing parts plus Arduino and other parts. You just need to follow the directions of the project, have a 3D printer and collect the material designed for the development of this protective equipment (PPE), which will ensure the minimum air flow to perform work in environments where COVID19 is present in such a way significant, and even in the face of catastrophes of bacterial Indole, it could be used in a particular way to safeguard health for the guaranteed minimum time. The manufacture of the P.A.P.R. Task Force is designed to be carried out in a DIY way but it does not mean that it can be marketed industrially since we think that other manufacturers are not giving the necessary stock and it could be thought of carrying out industrial processes on the project as its implementation is easy.

##Challenges I ran into?
To do this with low cost. Faithfully comply with the EU regulations applicable to this type of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Easily solve user interface.
 
##Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Design of a reliable system. Offer a simplified solution to professionals and, if necessary, even to the whole world, due to issues, hopefully never occurring, of biological / chemical wars.

##What I learned
Most of the production of medical equipment should not be allowed to be done just in in China, Europe has to learn this lesson.
We always learn.

##What's next for Coronavirus Makers PAPR Task Force
*Continue helping the community
*Offer open license issue, but study the possibility of industrializing the construction of our solution.
*Improve MVP and look for industrial partners in order to homolagate and manufacture.

##Built With
arduino, autodesk-fusion-360, freecad, presures ensors, sketchup, kidkad, fabrics, 3d-print
